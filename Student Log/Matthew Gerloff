Issues

+1/21/21 	Joined class late and missed first class meeting as well as first group meeting

+1/28/21  Less group members at recent team meetings makes group communication that much tougher

+ 2/8/21  While researching for map charts I stumbled upon a feature formally known as Fusion Tables, that google unfortunately discontinued as of 2018 that had easy publish feature for its map charts to be sent to any website. (Since this I was able to find the geocharts feature)

+ 2/14/21 Winter storm this weekend knocked out my power and internet. Sunday evening the power has finally come back on and I could shower again. The internet is still out, so I upgraded my phone plan to unlock the Personal Hotspot feature.

+ 2/14/21 I am able to stay connected with my personal hotspot but in our team group chat I have found out other members are experiencing tech difficulties as well due to this storm. We had to cancel our planned team meeting tonight due to this. I worry that a prolonged outage could hurt our momentum. 

+ 2/21/21 No issues currently
