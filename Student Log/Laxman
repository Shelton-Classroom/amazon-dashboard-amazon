PIG REPORT-Laxman Chamlagai

I’m the web designer in the project and will be working on developing the company’s website. Following are the tasks assigned to me:
	Create visual outline for AmazonDashboard application.
	Design and create a company logo.
	Develop UI of the website.
Progress:
WireFrame:
The visual outline for the application is completed. An example is the attached wireframe. 
Application will be developed using HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap,JQuery, JavaScript languages and its libraries. 
It will be designed to be a fully responsive application.
Tools needed for development work is fully installed and functional. 
I also started looking into some front end application templates to kick start the development work. 

Issues:
One of the issues I have right now is converting the company logo to a oval shape using PS. 
Team thought is to use an oval shaped logo but will also accept if the logo is not oval and is a rectangular.

Goals:
My goals is to have the at least actual front end one page is developed by the end of the next week so the 
developers start to feel the application to map their code into the application. 


ISSUES with GITHUB:
When I paste the wireframe and logo, it is not pasting it here.
